# Rock Paper Scissors Game

## Description

The Rock Paper Scissors game is a classic hand game where two players simultaneously form one of three shapes with their hands. The possible shapes are "rock" (a fist), "paper" (an open hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index and middle fingers extended, forming a V). The game has simple rules:

- Rock crushes scissors.
- Scissors cuts paper.
- Paper covers rock.

});
